<p> If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. </p>

<p> As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery. </p>

<h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
  <p> I think these results will make me more aware of the type of person I can be with takin over tasks and not letting everyone else have an opinion or voice. I think it will influence my behaviour by allowing people to contribute together instead of taking charge.   </p>
  
<h3> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
  <p> I should make myself aware of other people and the type of people I form a group with and avoid groups that are disorganised and with all extraverts as we may well just all clash.  </p>

<h2>  Project Idea </h2>

<p> Learning App for Children with Learning Difficulties </p>

<h3> <p> Overview </p> </h3>
<p> I would like to develop an app for children with learning difficulties such as Dyslexia, Irlen, central auditory processing disorder and deafness just to name a few. I want the app to be widely accessible to those that have multiple difficulties with learning. The idea is to be able to have one app that caters to multiple difficulties rather then just 1 app for individual learning disabilities instead of needing to download multiple apps on devices. The app would include the ability to evaluate the child’s needs as they progress through the learning levels.  </p>

<h3> <p> Motivation </p> </h3>
<p> My motivation behind the idea of this app is my daughter and other children like her. She was recently diagnosed with Iren, central auditory processing disorder and partial deafness which all impacted her ability to learn the same way as her peers. She had fallen behind in school and after doing much research and multiple app downloads to find that many where either not the right fit for her or that she has to use multiple apps to help her improve. We also need to have her formally assessed every 12months to see her progress, as this is outside of her comfort zone, she feels anxious and while she may be able to do something at home finds it more difficult under assessment criteria.  </p>

<h3> <p> Description </p> </h3>
<p> After speaking with a few teachers, it was made more evident that there is a higher increase in the number of children that are being diagnosed with multiple learning difficulties and having one app that could help multiple children would be extremely beneficial.</p> 
<p> My app will consist of multiple learning features such as the following: </p>
        <p> -	Colour tint overlay for children suffering from Irlen. </p>
        <p> -	Ability to practice learning techniques and the correct way to form letters and numbers. </p>
        <p> -	Sign language for children with deafness or partial deafness including a section on how to learn sign language. </p>
        <p> -	The option to change the tone, pitch and sex of the voice that is speaking to suit the child’s needs. </p>
        <p> -	Speech development. </p>
        <p> -	Teaching different sounds of letters and the multiple sounds letters can make. </p>
        <p> -	Learning phonics. </p>
        <p> -	Identify upper- and lower-case letters. </p>
<p> While I have listed many of the features above, I will also be including a section for children to learn and practice techniques on calming down in stressful situations that may make them anxious and want to lash out or play up. In this section it will include calming down music, breathing techniques to practice and meditation to reduce their anxiety levels faster to be able to return to their task more quickly. </p>
<p> The app will also include a section for parents and teachers to be able to do assessments on the child in the comfort of the home and then send the results to the specialist in that field for them to access the results and see the development of the child. In the parent and teacher section it will also include information for them and where they can access more support to assist their child and places to find more information to understand the child’s difficulties a little more. </p>
<p> By being able to screen the child more often will mean that if the needs change, they can pick it up sooner rather then later and get on top of it for the benefit of the child. It will also give teachers and parents the information they need on what areas the child may need more attention on. </p>
<p> As the child progresses each level and completes it, they will receive a certificate that can be emailed and printed for them to keep and see the progress they are making. While the app will be designed to help improve the ability of learning for each individual child it will be done in a fun educational way, so the child does not get bored and not want to use the app but instead keep them focused and interested. This will allow the child to think they are playing when in actual fact they are learning at the same time. I believe this will help develop the fundamental learning to help each child to succeed. 
 </p>

<h3> <p> Tools and Technologies </p> </h3>
<p> Tools that would be needed to build and develop such an app would include an app builder such as firebase or appetizer as I am familiar with both of these. Building the app would require specific programming to allow the learning to flow easily. The app would require access control and permissions to use the devices microphone and speaker and other certain functions. The use of mobile development software would be required to carry out the correct coding. For the different graphics it will also need a graphical user interface for each component. </p>

<h3> <p> Skills Required </p> </h3>
<p> Skills required to develop such an app would first include the skills of those that have studied the field of each difficulty to ensure the content that is put into the app will be beneficial to the user and their needs. It will also require the skills of professionals that do the assessments to ensure the right screenings are used to achieve the best outcomes. Other skills would be being able to develop complex coding to ensure each component runs without errors. A specific program would need to be established to make sure the flow of the app was running at the best possible level. The feasibility of these skills would not be hard to find as there are many specialists out there that I am sure would be more than willing to contribute and as there are many individual apps for each learning ability, I am sure that it would not be hard to find the programing and coding skills required.  </p>

<h3> <p> Outcome </p> </h3>
<p> If the app was successful it would make a world of difference to children with difficulties in learning to stay up to date with their peers. I also believe that for parents and teachers it will make monitoring a child’s development more easily, which will allow the child to excel in areas and assist the child in the areas they are struggling. The biggest impact this app will have is helping those that need it the most and impacting their lives so the do not constantly feel like they are being left behind by not understanding the work the same as their peers. This app will also allow the screening to be done more often and give the ability to see when the child’s needs change. This app will replace the need for multiple apps thus reduce the cost of purchasing multiple apps that are not focused on multiple learning difficulties at once. </p>
